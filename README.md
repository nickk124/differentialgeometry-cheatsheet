# A Differential Geometry Basics Cheat Sheet
A easy-to-use, quick and "to the point" cheat sheet of the important definitions and theorems found within differential geometry, for use in applications such as general relativity, information geometry, etc.

When I started learning differential geometry, I rapidly began to want a clear, concise reference manual for the important, and often heirarchical definitions found within the literature. This is my attempt at making one. Primarly adapted from Spivak's *A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry, 3rd Edition* and Mendelson's *Introduction to Topology, 3rd Edition*.
